# horiseon-accessiblity-challenge-one

The first challenge for the bootcamp. Horiseon accessibility challenge.

I was motiated to do this project because accessibility is important. Just because someone can't see as well as me does not mean they do not deserve to be able to view a webpage in its entirety.

I made these corrections so anyone who wants to view the webpage can. Even if they can't see it the same way I do.

I learned to be as precise as possible. The people who listen to page descriptions should have as clear of a description as possible. I would want to know everything that is in a picture. I also learned how much cleaner you can make code by simply cleaning it up and grouping differnt classes together if they have the same attributes, ie, text size, color, highlight, etc.

In this challenge I added accessibility to every single image in the index.html. They had no alt descriptios so I made sure to add as much as I could to each item that did not have any. I also cleaned up the css style sheet. There were several repeats for different classes so I just made sure to group them together. I did this with D.R.Y in mind. Don't repeat yourself.
